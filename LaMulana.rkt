The La-Mulana Path Analyzer Program

La-Mulana is an archaeological exploration platforming game
dating back to 2006 as a fun retro freeware game released
for free.

In 2011, the game was re-released by it's developing company
Nigoro and released across several platforms slowly -
starting with the Wii Virtual Console (VC) platform.

La-Mulana is now a hit game across multiple platforms including:
* PC / macOS / Linux
* Wii VC
* PlayStation Portable Vita (PSVita)
* PlayStation 4
* Xbox One
* Nintendo Switch

The gameplay of La-Mulana is heavily based around exploration,
item collection, puzzle solving and combat. La-Mulana is a game
heavily designed for speedrunning. A normal, "first" playthrough
of La-Mulana could take you anywhere between 30-80 hours depending
on how lost you get. The speedrun is less than two hours.

Optimizing information in the game and remembering pathways is
vital to La-Mulana, and makes it very fun. There is a slight
amount of RNG in the game based on enemy drops or boss state machine
move cycles, but once you know the game, it's really fun to play
and try to get a lower time score.

The ending credits is where your total time is revealed, though
you can keep track of your progress in the pause menu.

This program is designed to reveal the most optimal path for
collecting items to beat the game.

Items are treated like a graph data structure, and collecting
a certain amount of items will let you eventually beat the game.

But which items do you need to beat? And do items require other
items to unlock? Yes, yes they do.

This program will attempt to:
* Tag all items in the game with their requirements
* Create a graph data structure representing all items
* Create a tree walk simulation program to emulate gameplay
* Analyze game paths and see what the most "optimal" order is


Gameplay Guide for those reading:
* La-Mulana is broken up into 19 different levels
* There are 9 rooms, each with two different sides - front and back
* There is at minimum one boss per each room
* The final boss requires all 8 main boss guardians to be defeated
* Certain items are needed to access each boss

Speedrun guide:
* Beat Boss 1 through 4, collect as many coins/items as possible
* Start working on backside rooms to reach Boss 5
* Collect more items, puzzles, and then gradually defeat Boss 6 and 7
* Collect another batch of important items, then defeat Boss 8
* Finally, collect all items and activate all puzzle pieces
* Defeat Boss 9, and then escape La-Mulana
