# La-Mulana Graph Planning

This is a tool to visualize, simulate and plan gameplay actions for the game La-Mulana.

La-Mulana is a complex platforming adventure game rich with puzzles and fun stories to uncover about ancient history, all while looking for long-forgotten treasures, all while being chased by menacing monsters.

La-Mulana's gameplay is that of a "collect-a-thon", that where you must collect a whole bunch of items before you are permitted to do more things in the game. You will not be able to open certain doors or defeat certain enemies until you get some items.

This code's goal is to model the route for obtaining all items in the game, and strategizing the order in which they are obtained.
